The table at the bottom stores and shows only KeyFrames. You can edit KeyFrames 
from there. 

Bottom right corner has a text box and a button "# of Frames in Animation" to 
specifically set the number of frames you want in the animation. This will be used 
to compute number of frames to be added between keyframes so that they are 
equidistant. The remaining frames are added after the last keyframe and are copies
of this last keyframe. 

Once the # of frames have been specified, you can use the slider of the left side
of the screen and scroll through all the frames in the animation. Frames are 
generated one by one and are not stored. The text above the slider is updated to 
reflect the type of frame that is being currently viewed. If a Frame is edited, then
it is changed to a keyframe and added to the correct position in the table. 
Frames will be recalculated to reflect this change. 

Hit play to view the animation, pause to pause it, and stop to stop it. Make sure
you click in the table before you hit play so that it will know where to start the 
animation. In general for my program, it's good to click on the frames in the table.


Extra Credit:
Variable playback speed: 
The text box and the "Set Sec Elapsed" above the play button allows user to specify
how many seconds you want the animation to approximately last. This will recalculate
the number of frames needed to achieve this and subsequent click of play will reflect
this change. Thus, allowing users to change the playback speed. 

Fade in fade out: 
There are two buttons corresponding to fade in and fade out. They will add a keyframe
to the beginning or end (fade in and fade out respectively) and spread of frames will 
be recalculated. When you play the animation, this will show a fade in and/or fade out. 

Non-linear animations: 
Click the "Nonlinear Play" button and it will play slower and slower in a non-linear
fashion.
